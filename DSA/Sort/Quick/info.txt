⚡ Quick Sort
📖 Description

Type: Divide & Conquer algorithm

Idea:
Choose a pivot element.
Partition the array so elements smaller than pivot go left, and elements greater than pivot go right.
Recursively apply Quick Sort to subarrays.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n²) (when pivot is always smallest/largest).
Space Complexity: O(log n) (recursive stack).
Stability: ❌ Not stable.

📌 When to use?
Fast in practice for large datasets.
